  Set up a Vertex AI RAG Engine corpus (Agent Platform) in serverless mode and
  wire it into an ADK agent. Use when the user wants to "create a RAG corpus",
  "build a RAG store", "ground my agent on documents", "add retrieval to my
  agent", or hits Spanner/allowlist errors creating a corpus. Covers GCS upload,
  serverless-mode switch, the LLM parser (custom parsing prompt), import,
  standalone retrieval testing, and exposing retrieval as a plain function tool
  (required so it can coexist with A2UI / other function tools).

# Vertex AI RAG Engine — serverless corpus + ADK integration

A RAG Engine **corpus** is a managed index: you point it at documents in Cloud
Storage (or Drive), it chunks + embeds them, and stores the vectors in a managed
vector database. An agent then queries the corpus at runtime through a
**retrieval tool** and grounds its answers on the returned passages.

This skill builds a corpus in **serverless mode** — the cheapest, no-allowlist,
fully-managed option — and shows how the agent consumes it.

## Mental model (how it works end to end)

```
Ingest (once):   docs in GCS ──▶ LLM parser ──▶ chunk ──▶ embed ──▶ managed Vector Search
                                (custom prompt)         (text-embedding-005)

Query (runtime): user turn ─▶ agent LLM decides to call the retrieval tool
                            ─▶ tool runs retrieval_query(corpus, text) ─▶ top-k chunks
                            ─▶ chunks injected into the model's context
                            ─▶ model writes a grounded answer (optionally cites)
```

Two moving parts: **the corpus** (built once, below) and **the retrieval tool**
the agent calls (last section). The agent never talks to the vector DB directly —
it calls a tool, the tool calls the RAG service.

## Deployment modes — pick serverless

| Mode | Backend | Allowlist? | Cost | When |
|------|---------|-----------|------|------|
| **Serverless** (preview) | managed Vector Search | No | No service charge | **Default / tutorials** |
| Spanner (Basic/Scaled tier) | `RagManagedDb` (Spanner) | Yes in us-central1/-east1/-east4 | Spanner infra | CMEK, data residency, dedicated instances |

Serverless is **us-central1 only** and needs the **`vertexai.preview.rag`**
namespace — the GA `vertexai.rag` namespace only exposes Spanner `tier=` and
cannot select serverless. Serverless does **not** support CMEK / data residency /
Access Approval.

## Prerequisites (one-time)

```bash
PROJECT=your-project-id
gcloud config set project "$PROJECT"

# Enable the APIs. vectorsearch is required because serverless uses it as backend.
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com vectorsearch.googleapis.com --project="$PROJECT"

# Put your source docs in a GCS bucket (HTML/PDF/TXT/Google Docs supported).
gcloud storage cp ./my_docs/*.txt gs://your-bucket/rag/
```

**SDK version:** use a **current** `google-cloud-aiplatform` (≥ 1.90; verified on
1.163). The serverless-mode config and `rag.RagRetrievalConfig` used below do
**not** exist in older releases — e.g. 1.71 raises
`AttributeError: module 'vertexai.preview.rag' has no attribute 'RagRetrievalConfig'`.
Installing `google-adk` may pin an older aiplatform, so upgrade explicitly:
`pip install -U google-cloud-aiplatform`. (`vertexai.preview.rag` now emits a
deprecation notice pointing to the newer `agentplatform` client; the preview
namespace still works today.)

## Build the corpus

`scripts/create_rag_corpus.py`:

```python
from vertexai.preview import rag                      # preview namespace = serverless support
from vertexai.preview.rag.utils import resources as rr
import vertexai

PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
LOCATION   = "us-central1"                             # serverless is us-central1 only
GCS_PATH   = "gs://your-bucket/rag/"                   # a file or a prefix

# Custom instruction for the LLM parser — extract what matters, drop noise.
PARSING_PROMPT = (
    "Extract the individual useful facts and recipes described in this text. "
    "Ignore and omit all metadata, boilerplate, and image captions. "
    "Output clean, self-contained prose."
)

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

# 1. Switch the region's RAG managed DB to serverless mode (project-level, once).
cfg = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/ragEngineConfig"
rag.update_rag_engine_config(rag_engine_config=rag.RagEngineConfig(
    name=cfg,
    rag_managed_db_config=rag.RagManagedDbConfig(mode=rr.Serverless()),
))

# 2. Create the corpus. Serverless auto-selects the managed Vector Search backend;
#    you only choose the embedding model.
corpus = rag.create_corpus(
    display_name="my-corpus",
    embedding_model_config=rag.EmbeddingModelConfig(
        publisher_model="publishers/google/models/text-embedding-005"),
)
print("corpus:", corpus.name)   # save this — the agent needs it

# 3. Import + parse + chunk + embed. The LLM parser applies PARSING_PROMPT per file.
resp = rag.import_files(
    corpus_name=corpus.name,
    paths=[GCS_PATH],
    transformation_config=rag.TransformationConfig(
        chunking_config=rag.ChunkingConfig(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=100)),
    llm_parser=rag.LlmParserConfig(
        model_name="gemini-3.6-flash",
        custom_parsing_prompt=PARSING_PROMPT),
)
print("imported:", resp.imported_rag_files_count)
```

**Parser choice:** default parser (free, clean text) < **LLM parser** (semantic
extraction via a prompt — best for stripping boilerplate) < layout parser
(Document AI, best for tables/charts). Chunking still runs after parsing.

## Test WITHOUT touching agent code

Retrieval-only — confirms the index returns good passages, no LLM:

```python
from vertexai.preview import rag
import vertexai
vertexai.init(project="your-project-id", location="us-central1")

resp = rag.retrieval_query(
    text="what is good for a cough?",
    rag_resources=[rag.RagResource(rag_corpus="projects/.../ragCorpora/NNN")],
    rag_retrieval_config=rag.RagRetrievalConfig(top_k=5),
)
for c in resp.contexts.contexts:
    print(c.score, c.text[:200])
```

You can also test in the **Console**: Vertex AI → RAG Engine → your corpus →
Retrieve panel. After import, allow a short indexing lag (retrieval can 404
briefly even when the file shows `ACTIVE`).

## Wire it into the agent (ADK) — expose retrieval as a plain function tool

The agent accesses the corpus through a **retrieval tool**. Wrap
`rag.retrieval_query` in an ordinary Python function and register *that* as the
agent's tool. **Do this instead of ADK's `VertexAiRagRetrieval`** — see the
compatibility warning below for why this matters.

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent

CORPUS_NAME = "projects/.../ragCorpora/NNN"   # from create_rag_corpus.py

def consult_docs(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the herbal corpus and return matched passages.

    Args:
        query: What to look up (a plant, ailment, or recipe).
    Returns:
        The matched passages, or a note that none was found.
    """
    from vertexai.preview import rag
    try:
        resp = rag.retrieval_query(
            text=query,
            rag_resources=[rag.RagResource(rag_corpus=CORPUS_NAME)],
            rag_retrieval_config=rag.RagRetrievalConfig(top_k=5),
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Retrieval failed: {e}"
    contexts = getattr(resp.contexts, "contexts", [])
    passages = [c.text.strip() for c in contexts if getattr(c, "text", "").strip()]
    return "\n\n---\n\n".join(passages) or "No relevant passage found."

agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-3.6-flash",
    name="apothecary",
    instruction="Answer using the herbal corpus. Call consult_docs before answering.",
    tools=[consult_docs],   # alongside any other tools, e.g. the A2UI toolset
)
```

At runtime the model decides when to call `consult_docs`; the function runs
`retrieval_query` against the corpus and returns the top-k chunks as its result,
which the model reads and composes a grounded answer from. The docstring matters —
it's the tool's function declaration, so it's how the model knows when to reach
for the tool.

### ⚠️ Compatibility: do NOT use `VertexAiRagRetrieval` with other function tools

ADK's `VertexAiRagRetrieval` (from `google.adk.tools.retrieval`) does **not**
register as a normal function tool — it registers as Gemini's **built-in
retrieval grounding tool**. Gemini models **reject any request that offers the
built-in retrieval tool alongside ordinary function declarations on the turn that
carries a `functionResponse`**. So the moment your agent has *any* other function tool —
e.g. the A2UI toolset (`SendA2uiToClientToolset` / `send_a2ui_to_client`) — the
combination is illegal.

- **Symptom:** the first model request succeeds; the failure appears on the
  follow-up turn right after the first tool call returns — a bare
  `400 Bad Request ... INVALID_ARGUMENT` with no field detail. It looks
  intermittent/mysterious and burns a lot of debugging time.
- **The fix is the plain function tool above** — retrieval becomes just another
  function declaration, no built-in grounding tool is in the request, and the mix
  is legal on any model/version.
- **Don't** "fix" it by switching to a drifting alias like `gemini-flash-latest`;
  it happens to tolerate the mix today but is unreliable. Teach against a pinned
  model (e.g. `gemini-3.6-flash`).
- This is the general rule, not a RAG quirk: **no built-in tool** (retrieval,
  Google Search grounding, code execution) can share a request with function
  declarations. Expose the capability as a function tool whenever you also need
  function calling.

**Region gotcha (common in production):** a serverless corpus is `us-central1`
only, but your agent's model often runs elsewhere (e.g. `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global`).
`rag.retrieval_query` runs against whatever region the **aiplatform SDK** is
initialized to — if that's not the corpus's region you get `MethodNotImplemented / 404`.
The genai model client (env-based) and ADK session/memory services (explicit
`location=`) do NOT use the aiplatform SDK's initializer, so you can safely pin
just the RAG client to the corpus region:

```python
import vertexai
# region parsed from projects/<p>/locations/<region>/ragCorpora/<id>
vertexai.init(project="...", location="us-central1")  # before the first retrieval_query
```

To steer the model on *how* to answer, put it in the agent instruction, e.g.:
"When you rely on the Herbal's words, quote the passage verbatim in quotation
marks and name it as Culpeper's Complete Herbal; otherwise paraphrase."

## Troubleshooting

- `INVALID_ARGUMENT ... Spanner mode ... restricted to allowlisted projects` →
  you're on the GA namespace or Spanner mode. Use `vertexai.preview.rag` +
  `mode=rr.Serverless()`.
- `PERMISSION_DENIED ... Vector Search API has not been used` → enable
  `vectorsearch.googleapis.com`, wait ~1 min, retry.
- `NOT_FOUND No vertex rag corpus found` right after import → indexing lag; retry
  after a few seconds.
- Bare `400 ... INVALID_ARGUMENT` (no field detail) on the turn right after the
  first tool call returns → you're mixing `VertexAiRagRetrieval` (built-in
  grounding tool) with function tools. Expose retrieval as a plain function tool
  instead (see the compatibility warning above).
