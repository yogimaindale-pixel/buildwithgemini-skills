# 🚀 Build with Gemini · Track 3

### The starter kit for Track 3 of the Build with Gemini World Tour, and a showcase of what participants built with it.

Clone this repo, open [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google), and build your own agent-first app on Google Cloud. Every project in the [gallery below](#-featured-projects) was built the same way: prototyped with Antigravity and `agents-cli`, equipped with Memory, tools, and storage, deployed to Agent Platform, and given a face on Cloud Run.

## 🧩 Anatomy of a Track 3 Project

Every app in this collection is built from the same set of Google Cloud building blocks introduced in the lab. Once you understand this shape, you can read any project here at a glance:

| Layer | What it does | Powered by |
|---|---|---|
| 🤖 **The Agent** | The core reasoning loop | [ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) + [`agents-cli`](https://google.github.io/agents-cli/guide/getting-started/), scaffolded with [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google) |
| 🧠 **Memory** | Remembers facts across sessions | [Agent Platform Memory Bank](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/memory-bank) |
| 🗄️ **Structured data** | Inventory, records, lists | [Firestore](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore) |
| 🖼️ **Files & blobs** | Images, media, assets | [Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) |
| 🔧 **Tools** | Take real actions and fetch real data | ADK function tools |
| 🎨 **Media generation** | Creates images (and video) on demand | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image` (Nano Banana 2 Lite) · Omni (video) |
| 🧪 **Code sandbox** | Safely runs generated code | Agent Platform code execution |
| 🪟 **Agent-first UI** | Cards and tables instead of plain text | [A2UI](https://adk.dev/integrations/a2ui/) |
| 🌐 **Frontend** | A shareable web face | FastAPI proxy on [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) |

## 🧠 What's in this Repo

The `.agents/` folder teaches Antigravity how to build agents on Google Cloud.

### Skills

A **skill** is a bundle of instructions that loads automatically when it's relevant, so the agent gets the workflow right in fewer steps instead of rediscovering it each time.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`pick-your-agent-project`](.agents/skills/pick-your-agent-project/SKILL.md) | Brainstorm your app idea and write a project brief |
| [`troubleshoot-lab-setup`](.agents/skills/troubleshoot-lab-setup/SKILL.md) | Verify your environment and fix common setup errors |
| [`memory-bank-setup`](.agents/skills/setup-memory-bank/SKILL.md) | Add cross-session memory to your agent with Vertex AI Memory Bank |
| [`enable-a2ui`](.agents/skills/enable-a2ui/SKILL.md) | Make your agent reply with rich UI cards (A2UI) in the ADK dev UI |
| [`build-agent-frontend`](.agents/skills/build-agent-frontend/SKILL.md) | Generate a FastAPI chat frontend and ship it to Cloud Run |
| [`record-demo`](.agents/skills/record-demo/SKILL.md) | Record a branded demo video of your agent, with an optional AI soundtrack |
| [`publish-to-github`](.agents/skills/publish-to-github/SKILL.md) | Publish your finished project to your own GitHub and submit it for swag |

### Pre-configured tools (MCP)

[`.agents/mcp_config.json`](.agents/mcp_config.json) wires up two [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers that authenticate with your gcloud credentials, so the agent can look things up instead of guessing:

- **Firebase**: work directly with Firestore and other Firebase services
- **Google Developer Knowledge**: grounded access to Google's official docs (Cloud, Firebase, ADK, Agent Platform)

### Layout

```text
.agents/
├── mcp_config.json    # Firebase + Developer Knowledge MCP servers
├── rules/             # workspace rules (only deploy when asked)
└── skills/            # the workshop skills listed above
```

## 🧰 Build Your Own

The full, step-by-step walkthrough lives on the **[lab guide](https://cszhu.github.io/build-with-gemini/)**. This is the short version.

**Prerequisites** (the lab workstation comes with all of this pre-installed; you'll need it if you're running on your own machine):

- A **Google Cloud project** with billing enabled
- **[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google)** (`agy`), the coding agent that loads the skills above
- **[agents-cli](https://google.github.io/agents-cli/guide/getting-started/)**, built on the [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)
- Authenticated gcloud: `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`
- A personal **GitHub account** for the final publish-and-submit step

**Quickstart:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cszhu/build-with-gemini
cd build-with-gemini
agy
```

On startup, Antigravity scans the `.agents/` folder and loads the skills and tools above automatically. In the AGY prompt:

```text
/skills            # see the installed skills
/mcp               # confirm the firebase + google-developer-knowledge tools are connected
```

```text
Verify my setup.   # runs the troubleshoot-lab-setup skill to check your environment
```

Then follow the [lab guide](https://cszhu.github.io/build-with-gemini/) to design, build, deploy, and share your agent, start to finish.
